Packages:

        1. Packages are a way to connected indivisual classes to communicate with the other indivisual classes that are present in the same directory / project folder
        2. Packages are intialised through the keyword 'package ' and directory name as shown below

ex. -- > package (directory_name);

project-name/
├── sub-directory/
│   ├── App.java
│   ├── PrimaryController.java
├── bin

Note if the classes are in a nested directory then the proper way to initiate a package is.

                        package directory.sub_directory;






IMPORTANT: 

    (1) How to compile javafiles which are packaged or a grouped together
    (Ans) we can compile a sepific file in a directory by using packages as follows

EXAMPLE:   
    project-name/
    ├── sub-directory/
    │   ├── App.java
    │   ├── PrimaryController.java
    ├── bin

------> If we want to compile the java file named App.java we should direct it to the relative path such as

        step 1: first using cmd prompt navigate to the project-name directory
        step 2: view the App.java is present in the directory by using keyword "dir" + ENTER
        step 3: if is present in the directory let`s start
        step 4: get the relative path such as "sub_directory/App.java"

        step 5: compile the App.java file using the command
                "javac sub_directory/App.java"
        step 6: if compiled without any errors now run the file using the command
                "java sub_directory.App"

        NOTE: double the commands for compilation and executing a java file
